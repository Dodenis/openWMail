          I'm super excited to finally share this with all the pre-release users!
          We've been hard at work over the past few weeks getting something
          really awesome ready and released. That something is the next generation
          of WMail, we've called it <a href="https://wavebox.io" target="_blank">Wavebox</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          WMail has grown from a 3-day vacation project into something too big for me to
          maintain in my free time. That said, I'm still focused on evolving it into something
          that works even better for myself and everyone who uses it. To move WMail forwards,
          I'm now very proud and excited to announce that it is now part of Bookry,
          an amazing company that I've been part of for the last 5 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Myself and the team at Bookry have been busy adding more features and improving Wavebox
          which builds on all the great features of WMail and adds so many more! The big
          one right out of the box is support for more than just Gmail &amp; Inbox...
        </p>
        <img src="newsimages/05_04_17_wavebox_services.png" alt="Gmail, Google Inbox, Outlook, Office 365, Slack, Trello" class="center-block img-responsive" />
        <p>
          Thats right, as well as Google Inbox &amp; Gmail, Wavebox brings Outlook,
          Office 365, Slack, Trello &amp; Any Web link to the family. Meaning you have more
          online tools right at your fingertips.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's not all though. Wavebox is jam-packed with more features! Here's a brief
          overview of some of the other new things that that come in Wavebox...
          <ul>
            <li>Better Google Services integration</li>
            <li>Integrations with Microsoft Services</li>
            <li>Google Docs &amp; Office editing</li>
